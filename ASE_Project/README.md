This proposed QR Code-based Employee Attendance Management System is structured to record the attendance of employees in an organization. All the employees with registered IDs will get a QR code generated by the system, and they can record their attendance in the database using that QR code. 

From the use case diagram, we can see that there are two actors. One of the actors is an admin who can add new employees, check employee attendance, and report it. The other actor is the employee who can scan their QR code to record their attendance into the system and view their attendance from the start to the end date. 

Employees should use their details provided by the admin in the form of a QR code. After logging into the portal using the admin credentials, the admin can add new employees, check the employee attendance by using the start date and end date, and able to generate a report from the portal. Whenever a new employee is added to the database, the application will generate a QR code on the employee ID then the admin can download that image and give it to an employee with which they can register their attendance.
